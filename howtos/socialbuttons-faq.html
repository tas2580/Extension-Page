<h1>Social Media Buttons FAQ</h1>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Shares are not counted</strong><br />
		The number of shares will be cached so that you do not make too many querys at the social network. The time for caching can be set in the ACP.</li>

	<li><strong>Facebook shows the wrong image or description</strong><br />
		This can be a problem with the Facebook cache, go to https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/ and recache your URL.</li>

	<li><strong>2 clicks for privacy?</strong><br />
		This extension gets the number of shares over the webserver, so there is no connection between the user and the social networks,
		for that 2 clicks are not needed, your users have full privacy by displaying the buttons. Only when a user clicks on a button to share it
		will connect to the social network.</li>

</ul>
