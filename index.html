<h1>Welcome to my phpBB Extensions page</h1>
<p>On this website you can find information about the phpBB extensions that are developed by <a href="https://tas2580.net/">tas2580</a>.
If you need further extensions, look at the <a href="https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/extensions-36">Extensions database</a> on phpbb.com.</p>

<h2>What are phpBB Extensions?</h2>
<p>Extensions are downloadable packages which can be used to modify a phpBB forum or add new functions to the forum.
	Extensions can be used since phpBB 3.1. As opposed to Modifications in phpBB 3.0 there are no code changes needed for the installation of Extensions.
	To install an Extension, it must only be uploaded and activated in the ACP, that makes customising phpBB easier than ever.</p>
<p>The most phpBB Extensions are writen and suported by the community itself, there are only a few <a href="https://www.phpbb.com/extensions/official-extensions/">offical Extensions</a> that are developed and supported by the phpBB team.</p>

<h2>Get Involved</h2>
<p>If you have found a bug in any of my Extensions, it would be nice if you would report it.
	For that you can use the issue system on Github linket on the download page of every Extension.
	Also you can generate a new issue if you have suggestions for new features.</p>
